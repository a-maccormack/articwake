The articwake SD card image uses wpa_supplicant for WiFi configuration.

## Basic Configuration

Create `wifi.conf` in `/boot/articwake/` with your network details:

```conf
country=US
network={
    ssid="YourNetworkName"
    psk="YourNetworkPassword"
}
```

## Country Code

The `country` setting is required for regulatory compliance. Common codes:

| Code | Country |
|------|---------|
| `US` | United States |
| `GB` | United Kingdom |
| `DE` | Germany |
| `FR` | France |
| `AU` | Australia |
| `CA` | Canada |
| `JP` | Japan |

## Multiple Networks

You can configure multiple networks with priority:

```conf
country=US

network={
    ssid="HomeNetwork"
    psk="homepassword"
    priority=2
}

network={
    ssid="BackupNetwork"
    psk="backuppassword"
    priority=1
}
```

Higher priority networks are tried first.

## Hidden Networks

For hidden (non-broadcast) networks:

```conf
country=US
network={
    ssid="HiddenNetwork"
    psk="password"
    scan_ssid=1
}
```

## Enterprise Networks (WPA2-Enterprise)

For networks using 802.1X authentication:

```conf
country=US
network={
    ssid="EnterpriseNetwork"
    key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
    eap=PEAP
    identity="username"
    password="password"
    phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
}
```

## Open Networks

For networks without a password (not recommended):

```conf
country=US
network={
    ssid="OpenNetwork"
    key_mgmt=NONE
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi not connecting

1. Verify SSID and password are correct
2. Check the country code matches your region
3. Ensure quotes are properly formatted
4. Check `/var/log/articwake-setup.log` for errors

### Finding available networks

SSH into the Pi and scan:

```bash
iwlist wlan0 scan | grep ESSID
```

### Checking connection status

```bash
# Check if connected
iwconfig wlan0

# Check IP address
ip addr show wlan0
```

### Manual connection test

```bash
wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -d
```
