description: Secure remote access with Tailscale VPN.
---

Tailscale provides secure, zero-config VPN access to your articwake instance from anywhere.

## Why Tailscale?

- **Secure by default**: All traffic is encrypted end-to-end
- **No port forwarding**: Works behind NAT and firewalls
- **Stable IPs**: Tailscale IPs don't change
- **Easy setup**: Just one auth key

## Setup

### 1. Get an auth key

1. Go to [Tailscale Admin Console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
2. Generate a new auth key
3. Copy the key (starts with `tskey-auth-`)

### 2. Add to SD card

Create `tailscale_authkey` in `/boot/articwake/`:

```bash
echo "tskey-auth-xxxxx" | sudo tee /mnt/articwake/tailscale_authkey
```

### 3. Boot the Pi

On first boot, the setup script will:
1. Install Tailscale
2. Authenticate with your key
3. Join your Tailscale network

## Accessing articwake

After setup, access the web UI via:

```
http://<tailscale-hostname>
```

Find the hostname with:

```bash
tailscale status
```

## Using Tailscale IP for Homelab

For the most reliable setup, use your homelab's Tailscale IP in `config.env`:

```ini
ARTICWAKE_HOMELAB_IP="100.x.y.z"
```

This ensures articwake can reach your server even if local network conditions change.

## Key Types

Tailscale offers different key types:

| Key Type | Expiry | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| One-off | After first use | Single device setup |
| Reusable | Configurable | Multiple devices or reinstalls |
| Ephemeral | Never | Containers, short-lived VMs |

For articwake, a one-off key is usually sufficient.

## Troubleshooting

### Tailscale not connecting

Check the setup log:

```bash
ssh root@<local-ip>
cat /var/log/articwake-setup.log | grep -i tailscale
```

### Manually starting Tailscale

```bash
tailscale up --authkey=tskey-auth-xxxxx
```

### Checking status

```bash
tailscale status
```

### Re-authenticating

If your key expires or you need to re-auth:

```bash
tailscale logout
tailscale up --authkey=<new-key>
```

## Security Considerations

- Tailscale traffic is encrypted end-to-end
- Only devices on your Tailscale network can access articwake
- Consider using Tailscale ACLs for additional restrictions
- The auth key is deleted after first boot for security
