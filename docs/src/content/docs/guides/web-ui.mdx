description: Using the articwake web interface.
---

articwake includes a responsive, mobile-friendly web interface for managing your homelab server.

## Accessing the UI

Open your browser and navigate to:

- Local network: `http://<pi-ip>`
- Tailscale: `http://<tailscale-hostname>`

## Authentication

### Login

1. Enter your PIN in the login form
2. Click "Login"
3. You'll receive a session token valid for 15 minutes

### Session Expiry

Sessions expire after 15 minutes of inactivity. You'll be prompted to log in again.

### Rate Limiting

To prevent brute-force attacks, login attempts are limited to 10 per minute per IP address. If rate limited, wait 60 seconds before trying again.

## Status Display

After logging in, the status panel shows:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Homelab IP** | Your configured server IP |
| **Reachable** | Can ping the server |
| **initrd SSH** | Dropbear port is open (server waiting for unlock) |
| **System SSH** | Main SSH port open (server fully booted) |

### Status Indicators

- **Server off**: Not reachable, no SSH ports open
- **Waiting for unlock**: Reachable, initrd SSH open, system SSH closed
- **Fully booted**: Reachable, system SSH open

## Actions

### Wake

Sends a Wake-on-LAN magic packet to power on your server.

1. Click "Wake"
2. Wait for the server to power on (usually 10-30 seconds)
3. Click "Refresh Status" to check if it's reachable

### Unlock

Sends your LUKS passphrase to the server's dropbear SSH.

1. Enter your LUKS passphrase
2. Click "Unlock"
3. Wait for the system to boot (usually 30-60 seconds)
4. Click "Refresh Status" to verify

:::caution
The passphrase is transmitted to your server over SSH. It's never stored by articwake.

## Workflow

Typical usage:

1. **Open the web UI** from your phone or laptop
2. **Check status** - is the server reachable?
3. **Wake** - if server is off, send WOL packet
4. **Wait** - for the server to boot to initrd (~10-30s)
5. **Refresh** - check that initrd SSH is open
6. **Unlock** - enter LUKS passphrase
7. **Wait** - for full boot (~30-60s)
8. **Refresh** - verify system SSH is open
9. **Done** - your server is now accessible

## Mobile Usage

The web UI is designed to work well on mobile devices:

- Responsive layout adapts to screen size
- Large touch targets for buttons
- Simple, focused interface

## Troubleshooting

### Can't log in

- Verify your PIN is correct
- Check you haven't been rate limited (10 attempts/min)
- Verify the service is running: `ssh root@<pi-ip> "rc-service articwake status"`

### Wake not working

- Verify MAC address in configuration
- Check WOL is enabled in server BIOS
- Ensure Pi and server are on the same network segment (or broadcast address is correct)

### Unlock not working

- Verify the initrd SSH port is shown as open
- Check your LUKS passphrase is correct
- Verify SSH key is authorized in server's initrd
- Check `/var/log/articwake.log` for errors
