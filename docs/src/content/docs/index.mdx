## What is articwake?

articwake is a Rust-based web service designed for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W that lets you remotely wake and unlock LUKS-encrypted homelab servers.

**The problem:** You have a homelab server with full-disk encryption. When it's powered off, you can't access it remotely. Wake-on-LAN can power it on, but LUKS encryption requires entering a passphrase before the system boots.

**The solution:** articwake runs on a small, always-on Raspberry Pi. When you need your server, you:
1. Open the articwake web UI from your phone or laptop
2. Enter your PIN to authenticate
3. Click "Wake" to send a Wake-on-LAN packet
4. Click "Unlock" to send your LUKS passphrase via SSH to the server's initrd

Your encrypted server boots up, accessible from anywhere.
