articwake can be installed in several ways depending on your needs.

## Pre-built SD Card Image (Recommended)

The easiest option for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. See the [Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/).

## Pre-built Binaries

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/a-maccormack/articwake/releases/latest):

| Binary | Platform | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `articwake-x86_64-linux` | x86_64 Linux | Standard servers |
| `articwake-aarch64-linux` | ARM64 Linux (glibc) | Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM servers |
| `articwake-aarch64-linux-musl` | ARM64 Linux (musl) | Alpine Linux, static binary |
| `articwake-armv7-linux` | ARMv7 Linux | Raspberry Pi 2/3 (32-bit) |

### Using a pre-built binary

```bash
# Download
wget https://github.com/a-maccormack/articwake/releases/latest/download/articwake-x86_64-linux
chmod +x articwake-x86_64-linux

# Set required environment variables
export ARTICWAKE_HOMELAB_MAC="aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
export ARTICWAKE_HOMELAB_IP="192.168.1.100"

# Run
./articwake-x86_64-linux
```

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- Rust 1.85+ (edition 2024)

### Build steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/a-maccormack/articwake.git
cd articwake

# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Binary is at target/release/articwake
```

### Cross-compilation

For Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (aarch64):

```bash
# Install cross
cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross

# Build for ARM64
cross build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Or for Alpine Linux (static binary)
cross build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Available cross-compilation targets:

| Target | Platform |
|--------|----------|
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | Standard x86 servers |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | ARM64 with glibc |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` | ARM64 static binary |
| `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` | ARMv7 (Pi 2/3 32-bit) |

## Setup After Installation

Regardless of installation method, you need to:

1. [Generate an SSH keypair](/homelab/ssh-keys/) for connecting to your server's initrd
2. [Create a PIN hash](/reference/cli/) for authentication
3. [Configure environment variables](/guides/configuration/)

See the [Configuration Guide](/guides/configuration/) for details.
